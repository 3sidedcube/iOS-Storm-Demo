# Storm Demo
This project is a demo of the current Storm libraries capabilities, including code examples and a basic project setup.

## Setup
Storm is powered by a CMS. Downloading this project will pull the content from our default CMS template, however, we recommend that you [Sign up](https://stormcorp.co/#request-invite) to our beta and get your own CMS before you continue.

This project requires no setup, just hit run and watch as the project downloads your bundle and launches the full project.
